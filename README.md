# EFIT3D
A 3D implementation of the Elastodynamic Finite Integration Technique for simulating the propagation of elastic waves. Currently, the model is capable of simulating 2 materials in various geometries. Materials are defined by specifying Poisson's Ratio, Youngs Modulus, and density. Common scattering experiments involve defining a cylinder or sphere of material 2 surrounded by material 1.
